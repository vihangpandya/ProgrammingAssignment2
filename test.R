## This function is used to test the makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve functions to be created as part of the
## Coursera R programming course. It creates a random square matrix, passes it to makeCacheMatrix to create a
## list and then calls the cacheSolve function twice. The first time it should inverse the matrix. The second
## time it should fetch from cache.
